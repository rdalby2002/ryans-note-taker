## Description

In this ceaselessly busy thing we call life, it can be a quite daunting to sort and juggle all the ideas, plans, and tasks swirling through our brains. Wouldn't it be nice to have one succinct place to organize that chatter? Well now there is! I utilized Express to create a note-taking app that allows for notes to be written, saved and deleted at the user's behest. In doing so, I learned a great deal more about GET and POST routes, as well as grew my knowledge on DELETE routes from scratch. In addition, I learned how to create a Heroku repository, publish code to Heroku, and troubleshoot deployments via command logs.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use, access the Heroku deployment via this [link](https://ryancd-note-taker.herokuapp.com/). From there, click "Get Started", then write a title and text for your new note, then click the floppy disk icon in the upper right hand corner to save your note. To delete a note, simply click the red trash can next to that note's title and watch it disappear. The drafting, saving, and deleting processes are outlined in the following screenshot:

## Tests

If you wish to ensure all routes are working as intended, open Chrome DevTools and click network. From there, use the site's features. If all is working properly, you should see each request appear in the network tab with a status code of 200.
